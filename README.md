#### This project consists on an advanced Skyblock core made to scale massively.

This project is currently in ALPHA. Feel free to test it by compiling the code yourself. Basic island loading functionality is tested and working.

This project's backbone is [Cosmos](https://github.com/IllusionTheDev/Cosmos/), and at the moment is under heavy development, with no builds available.

------------

### Technologies Used:
- SpigotAPI
- MySQL
- SQLite
- Gradle
- Bungeecord
- Redis
- MongoDB

#### Plugin Hooks
- Cosmos (Handles all the loading/saving logic, hooks with WorldEdit, SWM support is planned)



------------

### Some thoughts:
SkyblockCore is incredibly difficult to develop, unlike a regular core, there is a lot of thought put into every line of code, the plugin is supposed to expect players switching across servers, proxies, players leaving mid-loading, different proxies for the same team members, all of it while handling all of the commands on the spigot side, so players on a survival server can't run skyblock commands.

If you'd like to help with the project, even as someone without any code experience, here are some things that would greatly help me out:

- Helping with the wiki
- Writing issues
- Planning
- Donating (purely your choice, there's no benefit other than making me happy)
