# This is the preferred database type. There are a few reasons why it may default to a fallback:
# - The database type is not supported by the server (MySQL as a cache database)
# - The database type is not registered
# - The database configuration is invalid (invalid credentials)
# If all fallbacks fail, the plugin will disable. This is a feature.
