  # The max-cached-worlds field represents the amount of worlds that are kept as loaded, but unused.
  # This serves as a buffer and helps provide quicker loading times at the expense of RAM.
  max-cached-worlds: 5

  # The max-unloaded-worlds field represents the amount of worlds that are kept as unloaded
  # But the files are still kept on disk. These worlds will be loaded back into memory if they are needed.
  # You should lower this amount if you are limited on disk space, or if you have a lot of worlds.
  max-unloaded-worlds: 25

  # The pre-generated-worlds field represents the amount of worlds that are generated on startup.
  # This should ideally match max-cached-worlds, but can be higher if you're expecting spikes on startup.
  pre-generated-worlds: 5

  # This is the amount of ticks that are waited between each generation of the pre-generated-worlds.
  # You should keep this as low as possible to prevent spiking after startup, but increase this
  # if you're running lower-end hardware, as creating worlds drastically lowers your TPS.
  batch-delay-ticks: 20

  # This is the amount of time that is waited between unloading and saving a world, and deleting it.
  # When using Paper (or forks of it), worlds are saved async after the world unload event is called,
  # which means that the world's contents aren't done saving and can corrupt or mess up the deletion process.
  deletion-delay: 10 seconds
