# This is a separate file for the cache database credentials
# The whole reason why this file exists is so that we can be organized and split priorities
# You can add as many files as you want on this folder, and as many databases as you want on each file

# Sample credentials format:

global:
  type: sqlite # postgres/mysql/mariadb/sqlite/mongo available by default
  name: island-storage/database # .db extension is added automatically

# mysql:
#   host: localhost
#   port: 3306
#   database: island
#   username: root
#   password: 12345
