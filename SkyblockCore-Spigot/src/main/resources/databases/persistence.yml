# This is a separate file for the cache database credentials
# The whole reason why this file exists is so that we can be organized and split priorities
# You can add as many files as you want on this folder, and as many databases as you want on each file

# Sample credentials format:

postgres: remote-sql # Postgres inherits remote-sql's credentials
mysql: remote-sql # MySQL inherits remote-sql's credentials
mariadb: remote-sql # MariaDB inherits remote-sql's credentials

remote-sql: # This can be anything (other than the storage identifiers), represents the name of the credentials
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  database: island
  username: root
  password: 12345

mongo: # Instead of inheriting, we can also define the credentials directly
  host: localhost
  port: 27017
  database: island
  username: root
  password: 12345

sqlite: # SQLite doesn't connect to a remote server, so we need to specify the file path instead
  name: island-storage/database # .db extension is added automatically


# Sample storage format, these names are hardcoded and cannot be changed:
# Hardcoded storage identifiers: island, profile, island-cache (found in the cache.yml file)

island:
  type: sqlite # postgres/mysql/mariadb/sqlite/mongo available by default

profile:
  type: sqlite
